# Chandrayan ðŸš€

> You can control the chandrayan by giving sequence of commands.


## Project Functionality

Spacecraft has position cordinates in 3d galaxy as (x, y, z) and it is facing one of six direction North(N), South(S), West(W), East(E), Up(U) or Down(D).

Spacecraft has mainly 2 functionalities
  1. Move the Spacecraft forward(f) or backward(b).
  2. turn the Spacecraft 90 degree to left(l), right(r), up(u), down(d)

*Note: f, b, l, r, u, d represents commands.*

### Move Function
After every move command spacecraft position will change. One of its cordinated will be incremented or decremented by 1. See below cases to understand move better.
Assume initial position as (x, y, z).
- Facing Direction = N and Command = f  --> new position (x, y+1, z)
- Facing Direction = N and Command = b  --> new position (x, y-1, z)
- Facing Direction = S and Command = f  --> new position (x, y-1, z)
- Facing Direction = S and Command = b  --> new position (x, y+1, z)
- Facing Direction = E and Command = f  --> new position (x+1, y, z)
- Facing Direction = E and Command = b  --> new position (x-1, y, z)
- Facing Direction = W and Command = f  --> new position (x-1, y, z)
- Facing Direction = W and Command = b  --> new position (x+1, y, z)
- Facing Direction = U and Command = f  --> new position (x, y, z+1)
- Facing Direction = U and Command = b  --> new position (x, y, z-1)
- Facing Direction = D and Command = f  --> new position (x, y, z-1)
- Facing Direction = D and Command = b  --> new position (x, y, z+1)


### Turn Function
After every turn command spacecraft facing direction will change. See below cases to understand turn better.
- Facing Direction = N and Command = l --> new Direction = W
- Facing Direction = N and Command = r --> new Direction = E
- Facing Direction = N and Command = u --> new Direction = u
- Facing Direction = N and Command = d --> new Direction = d
